Hey!! Welcome to our Corona Virus Predictor and Trends Analyser.

Corona Virus is recently spreading infectious disease especially in china and neighbour connecting countries.

We had make dataset given CitiusTech and also extract a lot of data set from external data for morality rate, transmission rate,population density and infected people travelling from one city to another.

while going our research we went to a news which stated that,"China government banned the Transportation Facilities in Wuhan and its neighbour cities which lies in Hubei province". So We are observed the trends in Hubei seperately and other cities collectively.

We model into two compartment for china region and one model for US prediction.

We have achieved an accuracy of 93.59 which means we are having error percentage of 6.41.

Since number of cases detected depends upon various factors which we have like:

1. Population density -- More than people will in congested place more the chance to get infected with disease. So, People must avoid congested places.
2. Morality rate -- Since, it is found Corona Virus has much lesser death rate as compared to eariler infection caused by the same family of viruses and It is found that this Virus is affecting more to those community have bad morality rate.
3. Transmission Rate - We have found from our research, being from same family of virus of SAR and MER virus ,it seems to have same transmission as of earlier.This is our of assumption.

Thanks !!!
# Jeevan-- I had SIR model for epidemic prediction for growth rate of coronavirus. I had achieved an accuracy of 94% with this SIR model and made seperate prediction for USA and china.
